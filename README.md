# QBnB - A shameless ripoff of AirBnB for the purposes of a CMPE 332 Databases project!

QBnB is a clone of AirBnB for Queen's Alumni, created as an extension to the CMPE 332 Databases project.
This app is the front end magic to a PHP script and a MySQL database. (MySQL sucks btw!)


Our Magical, unresized login screen, as taken on my iPhone:
